# Developing Extensions in JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a fun web-based user interface for scientists, developers and designers for exploration, analysis, visualization. It is a flexible and highly extensible set of components that allows users to customize and enhance the existing experience. In this tutorial, attendees will be guided through the process of creating a basic extension and taught about the core APIs that power JupyterLab.

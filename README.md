# JupyterCon Tutorial

[JupyterCon](https://jupytercon.com) will use this template to create a new repository for each tutorial, with speakers added as collaborators. 

We also include here [instructions for tutorial speakers](https://github.com/jupytercon/tutorial2020/blob/master/Tutorial_Speakers_Guide.md). 
Please follow these instructions carefully, and email us if you have questions: [jupytercon-tutorials@numfocus.org](mailto:jupytercon-tutorials@numfocus.org)

You can delete this file (or rename it) and replace it by a README file that targets the contents of this repository, populated with your tutorial materials.

## General information

JupyterCon 2020 is an online event that places heavy emphasis on providing learning opportunities for all participants. 
It is a project of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), with a fully volunteer team of organizers.

### What is NumFOCUS?

> NumFOCUS is a 501(c)-3 non-profit in the United States. 
Its mission is to promote open practices in research, data, and scientific computing by serving as a fiscal sponsor for open source projects and organizing community-driven educational programs. 
NumFOCUS envisions an inclusive scientific and research community that utilizes actively supported open source software to make impactful discoveries for a better world.

## Format for tutorials

Tutorials will consist of on-demand video presentations, and written materials presented in Jupyter notebooks. 
The notebooks should be complete and polished, amply narrated worked-out examples and exercises for participants. 

Tutorial basic format:

- Three or four Jupyter notebooks (at minimum), each notebook corresponding to "one lesson" – printed, estimate between 10–20 pages, or 17 to 35 min to read, per notebook.
- Estimate for the material to be 1.5 to 3 hours to work through interactively.
- The notebooks are complemented with videos, 25–30 min in length (not longer); at least one video per notebook.
- Optional exercises for participants, instrumented for auto-grading.
- One full tutorial may add up to total-time-on-task by the learners of about 4.5 hours.
